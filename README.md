I haven't written a line of React.js in over a year and miss it. So I'm going to play around with it again and try some cool front-end things out that I usually couldn't use professionally. 

List of things to do:
    * Decide on less/sass.
    * Get CI working.
    * Learn webpack or get gulp to cooperate with react.
    * Remember how react does routing.
    * Try cool shit.
