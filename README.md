I haven't written a line of React.js in over a year and miss it. So I'm going to play around with it again and try some cool front-end things out that I usually couldn't use professionally. 

List of things to do:

- [ ] Decide on less/sass
- [ ] Create a new logo because fuck Apple News.
- [ ] Get CI working with github.
- [ ] Learn webpack or get gulp to cooperate with react.
- [ ] Remember how react does routing.
- [ ] At some point create an npm package to do something (for training).
- [ ] Try cool shit.
